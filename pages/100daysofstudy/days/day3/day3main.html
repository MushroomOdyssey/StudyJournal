    <p>
        It's day #3 of my 100 days of study!
    </p>

    <p>
        Today we're learning about &lt;a&gt; anchor elements, &lt;img&gt; image elements, their attributes and values,
        and navigating our folder structure.
        <br>That might sound a little dry, so I've decided to reward your patience (and mine) with some sorcerous
        kittens!
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>
        Anyone who ever owned a Myspace back in it's heyday may be very familiar with the following HTML:
    </p>

    <p>
        &lt;a href=" "&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
    </p>

    <p>
        &lt;img src=" "&gt;
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>
        Let's take a closer look at each of these, starting with &lt;a href=" "&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
    </p>

    <p>
        Here, the &lt;a&gt; tag refers to the <b>anchor</b> element - one of the most fundamental and widely used
        elements in HTML. Its primary purpose is to create hyperlinks, which are connections from one resource to
        another.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <b>href=" "</b> that follows is the <b>hyperlink reference</b> and it is an <em>attribute</em> of the anchor
        element that takes a <i>value</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can probably guess that the content inside of the <b>" "</b> is the attribute's <i>value</i> which, in this
        case, specifies the destination URL of the hyperlink reference created by the element.
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>
        So.. putting this all together:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The <b>&lt;a&gt;</b> element defines its content as an anchor.
            <br>&lt;a&gt;<a>anchor</a>&lt;/a&gt;
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>The browser recognizes this as an anchor, but that's about it</i>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <br>
        <li>
            The <b>href=" "</b> attribute establishes that the content is a clickable hyperlink - that it can be
            interacted with to navigate to another resource.
            <br>&lt;a href=""&gt;<a href="">hyperlink</a>&lt;/a&gt;
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>The browser recognizes this as an anchor with a clickable hyperlink, but there is no
                        destination</i>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <br>
        <li>And the value entered between the quotation marks <b>" "</b> is the destination that the hyperlink
            navigates to. Click the link to navigate to the second page of the Day 3 content!
            <br>&lt;a href="./pages/anchor.html"><a href="./day3pages/anchor.html">Day 3, page 2!</a>&lt;/a&gt;
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>The browser recognizes this as an anchor with a clickable hyperlink</i>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <br>

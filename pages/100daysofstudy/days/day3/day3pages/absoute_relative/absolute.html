        An absolute link is one that points to any location that uses the following struction for its destination:
    </p>

    <p>
        scheme://domain/path
    </p>

    <p>
        The <b>scheme</b> indicates the protocol that the browser must use to request the resource, for example http or
        https.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <b>://</b> is a character pattern that acts as a delimiter between the scheme and the domain. It has no
        special or inherent meaning. In fact, Tim Berners-Lee (the inventor of the World Wide Web, HTML, the URL system,
        and HTTP) decided to use this combination of symbols simply because the // was already familiar to him, and the
        : was more easily human-readable. However, he admits that one small change he would make - if he could do it
        over again - would have been to drop the // altogether and just use the : after http in URLs!
    </p>

    <p>
        The <b>path</b>, or more specifically the <b>path to the resource</b>, is kind of a map that points us directly
        to the content we would like to see. On a static website, this is literally the file structure of the folders
        and documents stored on the server. On a dynamic website, this is a logical path that is interpreted by the
        software that is delivering the content.
    </p>

    <p>
        There may be a huge string of apparent gibberish that is appended to some URLs. These <b>parameters</b> are
        often key/value pairs separated with the &amp; symbol. Web servers will use this information to perform some
        voodoo behind the scenes before presenting the resource to you.
        <br> You may also sometimes see an anchor to a specific section of the resource, identified in the URL by the
        &#35;.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Here are some examples of <b>absolute</b> links:

    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        But how do we actually "arrive" at these destinations?
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        If you think of a URL like a set of directions, an <b>absolute</b> link is akin to a street address:
    </p>

    <p>
        <i> 555 Ember Rd.
            <br>Dragon Valley, KA
            <br>United Kingdoms of New Albion
        </i>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        But while street addresses are formatted from most local (555 Ember Rd.) to least local (United Kingdoms of New
        Albion) our computer sees it in reverse, starting from the least local position and honing in on the most local
        end point. And unless it's been there before (or knows someone who has), it'll have to ask for directions:
    </p>

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            COMPUTER: <i>Oh, great and powerful Oracle of New Albion, have you knowledge of the great realm of Kah
                Le'Fornia?</i>
            <br>THE ORACLE: <i>Yes, young computer, it is yonder. I shall direct thee to the king.</i>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            After arriving in Kah Le'Fornia
            <br>COMPUTER: <i>Oh, wise and wondrous King, can you point the way to the dukedom of Dragon Valley?</i>
            <br>THE KING: <i>Yes, brave computer, it is yonder. This honorable knight shall guide thee to the duke.</i>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            After arriving in Dragon Valley
            <br>COMPUTER: <i>Oh fearsome and pious duke, can you point the way to Ember Road?</i>
            <br>THE DUKE: <i>Yes, foolish computer, it is yonder. Follow the ashen trail. Praise the flame!</i>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            After arriving in Dragon Valley
            <br>COMPUTER: <i>My quest is complete, and my destination is at hand!</i>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        So what does this process look like here in the real world if we wanted to go to www.example.org/page1.html?
    <ul>
        <li>
            Well, first a request is sent to the root server, asking, <i>"where can I find .org?"</i>.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Our computer is redirected by the root server to the .org top-level domain (TLD) server, where it then asks,
            <i>"where can I find example.org?</i>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Our computer is redirected once again by the TLD server to the authoritative name server, where is asks,
            <i>"what's the IP address of www.example.org?"</i>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            The authoritative server responds with the appropriate IP address which leads the computer directly to
            www.example.org, where it sends its final request directly to the server for the page1.html resource.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

        A <b>relative</b> link is very different. It points to a familiar location that's easily within reach.
        You just need some basic directions to get you pointed in the right direction.
    </p>

    <p>
        Instead of a starting location of "the whole world" and narrowing it down, you start from wherever you happen to
        be when you ask the question.
        <br>FOOLE: <i>Excuse me noble sire, where might I find the privy?</i>
        <br>NOBLE: <i>"Down the hall. Left past the second suite of armor."</i>
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>
        In other words, they are instructions that might change <em><b>relative</b></em> to your current
        location.

        Below is an example of two webpages in my Day 3 collection, from the perspective of where we are right now, on
        this page:
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="../../day3main.html">../../day3main.html</a> head back one step, then head back one more step,
        where you will find day3main.html
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="./absolute.html">./absolute.html</a> here, in the directory you are currently occupying, you
        will find
        absolute.html
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        We're almost there... the <a href="../pages/images.html"><b>Images</b></a> page is our last stop before
        those
        sorcerous kittens I promised you so long ago!
    </p>

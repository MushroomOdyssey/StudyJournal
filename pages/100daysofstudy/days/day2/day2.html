    <p>
        Today I would like to explore the concept of semantics so that we can appreciate the impact it has in our lives
        and in our HTML.
    </p>

    <p>
        To kick things off, let's define the word itself. A quick dictionary search of the word <i>semantic</i> reveals
        the following definition:
        <br><i>Relating to meaning in language or logic</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        That's rather vague, isn't it? Let's dig a little deeper.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        When I write the word "fluffy", and you read it, there's actually a lot going on. You see a collection of
        symbols on a page that come together to represent a series of noises that we would make to each other if we were
        standing face-to-face. These noises and the symbols that represent them convey the meaning of the word as we
        understand it - which might change a little by region or culture.
        <br>But... it's more than that, right?
        <br>The word has a meaning outside of the symbols that we see and the sounds that we hear and even the
        definition that we have been taught to assign it. It conveys <em>emotions</em>, <em>feelings</em>, and maybe
        even <em>memories</em>.
        <br>All of those internal processes spring into action and you instantly associate this string of symbols with
        furry animals, soft tactile sensations, and plump shapes. The idea represented by each word is more than just
        the shape you see, or the color, or the feel, or the way it moves in the breeze, <em><strong>or</strong></em>
        all of these things together. I would argue that humans' understanding of a word is greater than the whole of
        the word's attributes.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        You might be thinking,
        <br><i>"But this is a journal about HTML... are you telling me that a browser needs to ruminate on the deeper
            meaning of the &lt;strong&gt; element before interpreting the code?"</i>
    </p>

    <p>
        Well, no... of course not. And if one did, we'd have far more to worry about than understanding semantics.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        But <em>we</em> need to understand how much more capable we are at this kind of thing than a computer is. So
        much of our understanding is inferred by the vast number of contextual clues we process without even really
        thinking about it. The browser can't think for itself (yet) and is therefor incapable of contextualizing
        information like a human being. We have to feed it that context manually and explicitly.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to understand the idea of semantics used in HTML, we have to set up a scenario where we can try to
        interpret information as though we were the browser - with zero context.</p>

    <br>

    <p>
        <u><b>So, let's do a little exercise!</b></u>
    </p>

    <p>
        I have list of twelve different words. Please think of a sentence that includes the word <i>run</i> from that
        list. But don't include either the word <i>run</i> or the word <i>run</i> in that sentence.
    </p>

    <p>
        Having trouble? Sorry, let me make that a little more clear.. here is the list! Now, please create a sentence
        using the word <i>run</i>, but not the words <i>run</i> or <i>run</i>:
    <ul>
        <li>run</li>
        <li>run</li>
        <li>run</li>
        <li>run</li>
        <li>run</li>
        <li>run</li>
        <li>run</li>
        <li>run</li>
        <li>run</li>
        <li>run</li>
        <li>run</li>
        <li>run</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        That didn't clear things up for you? Well, would it help if I gave you the definitions?
    <ul>
        <li>run - to move.</li>
        <li>run - to operate.</li>
        <li>run - to operate.</li>
        <li>run - to move.</li>
        <li>run - to extend to.</li>
        <li>run - to be a candidate.</li>
        <li>run - to smudge or spread.</li>
        <li>run - to escape.</li>
        <li>run - to operate.</li>
        <li>run - a vertical line of unraveled stitches in fabric.</li>
        <li>run - a sequential occurrence of circumstances.</li>
        <li>run - free and unrestricted access to.</li>
    </ul>
    Hopefully that helps, now please use the word <i>run</i>, but not <i>run</i> or <i>run</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Still not enough? Ok then, I'll provide some more context..
        <br>Please use the word <i>run (as in, to operate)</i> in a sentence but do not include the words <i>run (as in,
            to move)</i> or the word <i>run (as in, to move)</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I can still see that you are having some trouble. I guess I have to make this explicitly clear to you and
        provide all of the context myself.
        <br>From the following list of words and their definitions...
    <ul>
        <li>run - to move quickly on foot.</li>
        <li>run - to function or operate.</li>
        <li>run - to manage or conduct.</li>
        <li>run - to flow or leak.</li>
        <li>run - to come to or extend to.</li>
        <li>run - to be a candidate.</li>
        <li>run - to smudge or spread.</li>
        <li>run - to escape.</li>
        <li>run - to be in charge of or oversee.</li>
        <li>run - a vertical line of unraveled stitches in fabric.</li>
        <li>run - a sequential occurrence of circumstances.</li>
        <li>run - free and unrestricted access to.</li>
    </ul>
    Please use the word <i>run (as in to be in charge of or oversee)</i> in a sentence that does not include either the
    word <i>run (as in to move quickly on foot)</i> or the word <i>run (as in to flow or leak)</i>.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        Ah, you finally understand what I'm asking you to do! But that was a lot of work on my end.
    </p>

    <p>
        In turns out that we have to invest much more time, energy, and forethought into writing HTML than we do into
        normal conversation. This isn't because it's difficult or challenging to write HTML (or CSS), but because we
        aren't used to having to manually produce and connect the kind of context and information that our brains and
        environment normally provide for us.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        So, when it comes down to it, what does this all mean for writing HTML?
    </p>

    <p>
        It means that we have to use the resources provided to us deliberately and with a clear understanding of the
        impact of our choices.
    </p>

    <p>
        HTML provides the <b>skeleton</b> that the rest of our webpage is built upon and we have to make sure that the
        foundations we are putting in place are well formed. That means we have to get to know the elements and their
        intended purposes, become comfortable with the hierarchy of nested elements, and know where to &lt; &gt; open
        and
        &lt;/ &gt; close your elements. It also means that we will have to pay close attention to how our HTML, CSS, and
        eventually JavaScript interface with each other as we move forward.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        These first few pages will be very simple, with a barebones layout structure and basic syntax.
    </p>

    <p>
        As we continue forward, we will incorporate more and more of the tools being introduced in The Odin Project's
        curriculum, and the pages will start to come to life.
    </p>

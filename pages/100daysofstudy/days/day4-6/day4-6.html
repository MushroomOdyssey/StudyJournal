    <p>
        Days 4 through 6 of my 100 day journey are complete - almost a full week already! But what do I have to show for
        the last few days?

        <b>You're looking at it.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        No long journal entry this time, just a project update and a little commentary.
        <br>I've copied and updated everything from days 1 through 3 into a central directory, which I will be updating
        exclusively from now on - no more individual repos.
        <br>Honestly, I have no idea why I didn't do that from the very beginning. TOP has a habit of having us create a
        new repo for every project, so maybe that just got stuck in my head.
    </p>

    <p>
        In any case, all future journal entries will be collected here.
    </p>

    <p>
        The entries thus far have been pretty bare-bones in terms of layout. Just some text and a few basic elements.
        <br>This is intentional. For the most part, I don't want to introduce anything to these journal entries that I
        haven't yet covered in the curriculum. Granted, I had to break that rule just to get this journal up and
        running, and to occasionally get my point across in the entries.. but those deviations have been strictly
        necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
        Future pages will be looking gradually more and more presentable. While I could come back and spruce these
        ones up, I think that seeing the learning process in action would be more interesting. At least, it's more
        inspiring to me and at the end of the day, it's my journal after all ;&rpar;

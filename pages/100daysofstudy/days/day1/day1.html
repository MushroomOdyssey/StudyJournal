        What is the absolute bare minimum required to create a valid HTML webpage? It may surprise you, but all it takes
        is a small collection of 2 lines of HTML composed of 1 declaration, 1 HTML element, and at least 1 character.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        It looks like this:
    </p>

    <p>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        <br>&lt;title&gt;?&lt;/title&gt;
        <br>
        <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Granted, all that will get you is an empty page, but it is a perfectly <em>valid</em> empty page.
    </p>

    <p>
        This can be
        confirmed by checking the code in the Nu HTML Checker created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) - a
        non-profit organization
        responsible for
        developing the standards that are used across the whole of the
        Web.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        Let's take a look at each piece of this proto-webpage's HTML:
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        <b>&lt; &gt;</b>
        <br>The angle brackets &lt; &gt; are fundamental to HTML syntax. Anything inside of a pair of angle
        brackets is
        considered <b>markup</b>.
        <br>It's in the name! [H]yper[T]ext (one word) [<b>M</b>]<b>arkup</b> [L]anguage.
        <br>Anything defined as markup is interpreted by the browser as <em>instructions</em>, and not content.
        <br>You can imagine that using &lt; &gt; is somewhat like speaking to a dog. For the most part, you speak in a
        normal conversational tone to and around a dog and it will continue to happily go about its day while you do.
        But when you want your dog to <em>do</em> something, you may change your body language, alter your voice
        slightly, and enunciate your words more clearly:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Sit.</strong>
        <br>The dog sits.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Walk?</em>
        <br>The dog fetches its leash.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Shake!</em>
        <br>The dog lifts its paw for a handshake.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your dog is trained and well-behaved (which is unlikely), it will perform these commands on cue.
        <br>But if you don't adopt this change in communication style, your dog will likely not assume that it should
        act on these words.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>"I'm sorry Bob, I know it's what you want but I'm not going to <b>roll over</b> on this."</i>
        <br>The dog does not begin rolling cross the living room.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is the same with the browser. When we speak in a &lt;tone&gt; that it understands, it realizes <i>"oh, you're
            talking to <strong>me</strong>!"</i> and executes your commands.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will see this play out below.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        <b>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</b>
        <br>Now that we understand the function of the angle brackets, we can immediately see that this line is a set of
        instructions meant to be read and interpreted by the browser, not us.
        <br>Even though this line might appear at first glance to be composed of two parts, <b>!DOCTYPE</b> and
        <b>html</b>, it is actually a
        combination of three distinct instructions: <b>!</b>, <b>DOCTYPE</b>, and <b>html</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>!</b> lets the browser know that what immediately follows is a <b>declaration</b>, which imparts metadata or
        additional rules
        to its target. The target of a declaration could be the entire page, or just a small selection of text.
        <br>Declarations are rare in HTML, though every valid webpage must include the one mentioned here.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>DOCTYPE</b> informs the browser that you are about to tell it what type of document it's looking at.
        <br>See below.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>html</b>, when used as part of the !DOCTYPE declaration, signals to the browser that it is looking
        at an HTML document which it should interpret using the HTML version 5 standards.
        <br>Other versions of HTML had more complicated values here, such as version 4.01, which required values that
        looked more like this:
        <br><i>HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"</i>
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        <b>&lt;title&gt; &lt;/title&gt;</b>
        <br>Here we have another set of instructions, called an <b>element</b>. But you will notice some distinct
        differences between this element and the declaration above.

    <p>
        When the browser sees text enclosed in a &lt; &gt; pair, it will assume by default that the encapsulated
        text will be an <b>element tag</b>. That <b>!</b> pre-pended to DOCTYPE exists speficically to yell at the
        browser: "<em>I'M NOT AN ELEMENT TAG!.. I'm a declaration.</em>"
        <br>But what is a <b>tag</b> and what part of an <b>element</b> does it occupy? ...and what the hell even is an
        <b>element</b>??
        <br>I know, I know. I hate using terms before they've been defined. Unfortunately, there are <em>so many</em> of
        them and their uses and definitions are so woven into and amongst each other, I wouldn't even know how to begin
        without losing your attention entirely. So bear with me and we'll straighten this all out.
    </p>
    <p>
        A <b>tag</b> is an instruction that defines the starting and ending boundaries of an element.
        <br>Many tags come in pairs, each of which is itself enclosed by a pair of delimiting symbols.
        <br>The <b>&lt;</b> symbol is called the <b>start tag open</b> delimiter and it marks exactly where a start tag,
        the first half of a tag pair, begins.
        <br>The <b>&lt;/</b> sequence of symbols is called the <b>end tag open</b> delimiter and it marks exactly where
        an end tag, the second half of the tag pair, begins.
        <br>And the <b>&gt;</b> symbol is called the <b>tag close</b> delimiter and it marks exacty where any tag ends.
        <br><b>[start tag open] [tag] [tag close]</b> content <b>[end tag open] [tag] [tag close]</b>
        <br><b>&lt; start tag &gt;</b> content <b>&lt;/ end tag &gt;</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        An <b>element</b> is just the term used to describe a tag pair and its content: <b>&lt;title&gt;</b>Study
        Journal:
        Day
        1<b>&lt;/title&gt;</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        As mentioned above, most tags come in a pair which enclose the content that the tag is modifying.
        <br>The simplest way to represent this is as follows:
        <br>
        <br>...content... <i>Begin instruction here--&lt;tag&gt;</i> modified content
        <i>&lt;/tag&gt;--End instruction here</i> ...content...
        <br>
        <br>You've already witnessed the effect that a tag pair has on it's content many times on this page.
        <br>
        <br>...content... <b><i>modified content</i></b> ...content...
    </p>
    <p>
        But some tags exist alone, without the need for an end tag, and make up an entire element by themself.
        <br>Dramatically named <b>void</b> elements, they do not modify any content and therefor do not need an end tag.
        These can also be referred to as <b>self-closing tags</b>, if you have a preference for dull conversation.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        <b>?</b>
        <br>At lease one character in length, this <b>?</b> could have been anything, but the content of &lt;title&gt;
        &lt;/title&gt; must not remain blank or empty.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        Not too bad, right? But.. why did I call it a <em>proto-</em>webpage at the start of this journal entry?
        <br>Well, that's because the browser is actually doing some work here filling in a lot of blanks.
        <br>Browsers kind of know what to expect from HTML and their method for understanding an HTML document implies
        the existence of a few more elements that the browser infers if not stated in the document.
    </p>
    <p>
        So when we write:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</b> <i>-- tells the browser which HTML standards to use</i>
        <br><b>&lt;title&gt;?&lt;/title&gt;</b> <i>-- gives the page a name shown in the browser tab</i>
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>The browser infers the following:</p>
    <p>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        <br><b>&lt;html&gt;</b> <i>-- the root element of the webpage; all other elements are children of
            &lt;html&gt;</i>
        <br>
        <br><b>&lt;head&gt;</b> <i>-- holds the webpage's metadata: title, character encoding, styles, etc</i>
        <br>&lt;title&gt;?&lt;/title&gt;
        <br><b>&lt;/head&gt;
            <br>
            <br>&lt;body&gt;</b> <i>-- contains the actual content that is visible on the page - what you are
            reading right now!</i>
        <br><b>&lt;/body&gt;
            <br>
            <br>&lt;/html&gt;</b>
        <br>
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        There is obviously still a lot to learn about this basic structure, the HTML <b>boilerplate</b>, but we now have
        a general understanding of basic HTML syntax and the fundamental building blocks of webpage creation.
